note right of F1Controller
	The controller is wired to driver boards (not Wifi).
	Driver boards are dumb. They take instructions from the controller.
	Each farm can have many driver boards,
	each with a different sensor or motorsuite attached, 
	e.g. grow bed, sump, water reservoir, air quality, etc.
